# Aquarium-education-variant

It's a website project for educational purpose and is based on my another website project.(https://github.com/Yi-YaoWang/Aquarium)
We removed some unused code and add some educational thing.

It's free and welcome to try our code.
But it required you to set up your php emviorment in local.(That is we don't have the URL)

This project is coding by Yi-Yao, Wang and Shi-Feng, Zeng.
